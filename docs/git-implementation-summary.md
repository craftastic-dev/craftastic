# Git Implementation Summary

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Git Worktrees Over Clones
- ✅ **Use git worktrees** for each session
- ✅ One worktree = One session = One branch
- ✅ Shared .git directory saves disk space
- ✅ Fast branch creation and switching

### 2. GitHub Authentication Strategy
- ✅ **Use GitHub Device Flow** for local development
- ✅ Request proper scopes including `write:pull_request`
- ✅ Store encrypted tokens in PostgreSQL
- ✅ No SSH complexity - token-based auth only
- ✅ Support both local and production deployments

### 3. Credential Passing Method
- ✅ **Use environment variables** with GIT_ASKPASS
- ✅ Simple, secure, and works with HTTPS
- ✅ No SSH complexity for MVP
- ✅ Tokens scoped per environment

### 4. UI Architecture
- ✅ **Separate Git Panel** alongside terminal
- ✅ Real-time status updates
- ✅ Basic operations: status, diff, commit, push
- ✅ WebSocket for live updates

## Implementation Roadmap

### Week 1: Foundation
1. **Database migrations**
   - Add GitHub token fields to users
   - Add git_clone_path to environments
   - Add worktree paths to sessions
   - Create git_operations audit table

2. **Worktree service**
   - Implement WorktreeService class
   - Add worktree creation to session lifecycle
   - Test with multiple concurrent sessions

3. **GitHub Device Flow authentication**
   - Implement device flow initiation
   - Build polling mechanism
   - UI for showing device code
   - Encrypt and store tokens
   - Pass tokens to containers

### Week 2: Core Git Features
1. **Git API endpoints**
   - GET /api/git/status/:sessionId
   - POST /api/git/commit/:sessionId
   - POST /api/git/push/:sessionId

2. **Container integration**
   - Mount worktrees into containers
   - Configure git credentials
   - Test push/pull operations

### Week 3: UI Implementation
1. **Git Panel components**
   - Status display
   - File diff viewer
   - Commit interface

2. **Real-time updates**
   - WebSocket integration
   - Auto-refresh on file changes
   - Progress indicators

### Week 4: Polish & Testing
1. **Error handling**
   - Merge conflicts
   - Authentication failures
   - Network issues

2. **Performance optimization**
   - Cache git status
   - Efficient diff rendering
   - Cleanup strategies

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Create database migrations** for the schema changes
2. **Implement WorktreeService** with basic create/delete operations
3. **Add PAT input UI** to user settings
4. **Test worktree mounting** in Docker containers
5. **Build simple git status endpoint** as proof of concept

## Open Questions for Discussion

1. **Branch naming**: Should we enforce a naming convention for feature branches?
2. **Cleanup policy**: How long to keep inactive worktrees?
3. **Repository size**: Should we limit repo size or use shallow clones?
4. **Conflict resolution**: How much git conflict UI do we want in v1?
5. **Token expiration**: How to handle expired GitHub tokens gracefully?

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Large repositories**: Implement shallow clone option
2. **Token security**: Use encryption at rest, audit all operations
3. **Disk usage**: Monitor worktree storage, implement cleanup
4. **Performance**: Cache git operations, use efficient git commands
5. **Concurrent access**: Worktrees naturally isolate sessions

## Success Metrics

- ✓ Users can create sessions with different branches
- ✓ Git operations work seamlessly in containers
- ✓ UI shows real-time git status
- ✓ Push/pull works with private repositories
- ✓ Multiple sessions can work independently

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

1. GitHub OAuth for better UX
2. Repository browser/selector
3. Pull request integration
4. Advanced git operations (rebase, cherry-pick)
5. GitLab/Bitbucket support
6. Collaborative features

## Related Considerations

### Agent Credential Integration
Sessions will also need to support agent credentials (Claude, Anthropic API, OpenAI, etc.):
- Environment variables (e.g., `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)
- Config file mounts (e.g., Claude OAuth config)
- This affects container startup and credential management
- See `session-credentials-architecture.md` for detailed design
