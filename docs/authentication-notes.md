# Authentication Architecture Issues

## Current State (As of 2025-01-29)

### Problem Summary
The Craftastic Orchestrator has **incomplete authentication architecture**. We have backend APIs that expect authenticated users, but no proper frontend user registration/login system. This has led to several hacky workarounds.

### Backend Authentication Expectations
The backend APIs expect:
- User authentication via JWT tokens (`@fastify/jwt`)
- `request.user.id` to be populated by auth middleware
- User ownership verification for resources (environments, sessions, etc.)

### Frontend Authentication Reality
The frontend currently has:
- **No user registration system**
- **No login/logout UI**
- **No JWT token management**
- **localStorage-based fake user IDs** (`user-${Date.now()}`)

### Hacky Workarounds Implemented

#### 1. Development Mode Bypass
In `src/index.ts`:
```typescript
// Development authentication bypass for testing
if (config.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  server.addHook('preHandler', async (request, reply) => {
    // Allow test authentication via header in development
    if (request.headers['x-test-user-id']) {
      request.user = { id: request.headers['x-test-user-id'] };
    }
  });
}
```

#### 2. Frontend Header Injection
In `frontend/src/api/client.ts`:
```typescript
// In development, add test user ID header
if (import.meta.env.DEV) {
  const userId = localStorage.getItem('userId') || `user-${Date.now()}`;
  headers['x-test-user-id'] = userId;
}
```

#### 3. User Service ID Resolution
The `userService.resolveUserId()` function tries to handle both UUIDs and legacy string IDs, adding complexity.

### Issues This Creates

1. **Production Broken**: The development bypass won't work in production
2. **No Multi-User Support**: Can't have multiple real users
3. **No Persistent Identity**: User IDs change on browser refresh/clear
4. **Security Gap**: No actual authentication/authorization
5. **GitHub Auth Orphaned**: GitHub tokens are saved but can't be properly associated with persistent users
6. **API Inconsistency**: Some routes expect auth, others don't

### What Should Be Implemented

#### Frontend Needs:
- [ ] User registration page (`/register`)
- [ ] Login page (`/login`) 
- [ ] JWT token storage and management
- [ ] Authenticated route protection
- [ ] User profile/settings page
- [ ] Logout functionality

#### Backend Needs:
- [ ] User registration endpoint (`POST /api/auth/register`)
- [ ] Login endpoint (`POST /api/auth/login`)
- [ ] JWT token validation middleware (remove dev bypass)
- [ ] Password hashing (bcrypt)
- [ ] User management routes

#### Database Needs:
- [ ] Proper `users` table with email/password
- [ ] User session/token management
- [ ] Migration from fake user IDs to real users

### Current User Flow (Broken)
1. User opens app ‚Üí Gets random `user-${timestamp}` ID
2. Creates environments/sessions ‚Üí Associated with fake ID  
3. Refreshes browser ‚Üí Gets NEW fake ID ‚Üí Loses access to old resources
4. GitHub auth ‚Üí Tokens saved but orphaned when user ID changes

### Proper User Flow (Target)
1. User visits app ‚Üí Redirected to login/register
2. User creates account ‚Üí Real user record in database
3. User logs in ‚Üí JWT token issued and stored
4. User creates resources ‚Üí Associated with persistent user ID
5. User can logout/login ‚Üí Maintains access to their resources
6. GitHub auth ‚Üí Properly tied to persistent user account

### Temporary vs Permanent Solutions

**Current approach is purely temporary** for development. Before any production deployment, we need:
1. Complete authentication system implementation
2. Migration strategy for any existing fake-user data
3. Removal of all development bypasses
4. Proper security audit

### Files That Need Changes
- `src/index.ts` - Remove dev bypass, add proper auth middleware
- `src/routes/auth.ts` - Add registration/login routes (doesn't exist yet)
- `frontend/src/pages/Login.tsx` - Create login page
- `frontend/src/pages/Register.tsx` - Create registration page  
- `frontend/src/api/client.ts` - Replace fake headers with JWT token management
- Database migrations - Add proper users table with auth fields

## GitHub OAuth Configuration

### Shared OAuth App
Craftastic uses a shared GitHub OAuth App for Device Flow authentication:

- **Client ID**: `Ov23liz42T3AzHtmASDC` (safe to commit - public by design)
- **App Name**: Craftastic OAuth App
- **Scopes**: `repo`, `read:user`, `user:email`
- **Device Flow**: Enabled

### Security Notes
- ‚úÖ **Client ID is public** - Safe to commit to git and share
- ‚ùå **Client Secret** (if any) must be kept private
- üîí **Access tokens** are encrypted in database using `ENCRYPTION_KEY`

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# Required in .env
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=Ov23liz42T3AzHtmASDC
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-32-byte-hex-key-for-token-encryption

# Optional - defaults to $HOME/.craftastic
CRAFTASTIC_DATA_DIR=$HOME/.craftastic
```

### User Flow
1. User clicks "Connect GitHub" in terminal Git Panel
2. Device Flow generates code (e.g., `1077-B216`)
3. User visits GitHub and enters code
4. App gets access token for git operations (push, pull, commit)
5. Token stored encrypted in database, tied to user session

**Priority**: HIGH - This is a fundamental architectural gap that blocks production readiness.
